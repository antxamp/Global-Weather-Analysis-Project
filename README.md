# Global-Weather-Analysis-Project

## Overview of Project
From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map. Inluding creating a dataframe for weather.

### Rescources: 
##### Google Places API, Google Directions API, Jupyter Lab 3.0, Python 3.8 

### Objective:
###### Deliverable 1: Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. And also, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

###### Deliverable 2: Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

###### Deliverable 3: Use Google Directions API to create a Travel Itinerary Map that shows routes between four cities.Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

## Results: 
###### Deliverable 1: Image of the final Weather_Database_df

###### Deliverable 2: A possible destination for a customer using the Vacation Search map

###### Deliverable 3: A sample of a travel itinerary map with routes and pop-up markers.
